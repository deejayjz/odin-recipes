    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Perfect for a family movie night. These yummy treats are the perfect mix of sweet and salty.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>1 bag Popcorn</li>
    <li>1 cup White Chocolate Chips You can use candy melts as well</li>
    <li>3 drops Green Food Dye</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons Milk or Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
    <li>Place popcorn bag in microwave and cook according to the instructions</li>
    <li>Melt the chocolates or candy melts according to the instructions. I prefer to use a double boiler. If you are like me
    and don't own one don't worry they are easy to make. All you need in a pan and a bowl (glass or metal) to go over it.
    The bowl should not touch the water. It creates a seal with the bottom pan to trap the steam produced by the simmering
    water. To use the double boiler, add water to the pan and bring it to a simmer, then place the bowl on top and fill it
    with whatever you intend to cook or melt. I like it best because you can match the chocolate so you don't overheat it.</li>
    <li>Use a metal spoon to stir the chocolates as they melt.</li>
    <li>Add in milk or cream a couple of splashes at a time. Continue stirring until it is all mixed together. Add green food
    coloring. I used three drops, but added one at a time to get the color to the right slime color.</li>
    <li>Keep stirring and before you take it off the heat you can test to make sure it ready to drip onto your popcorn.</li>
    <li>It will cool fast so drip it onto the popcorn right away. I dripped some on the bag to add to the d√©cor.</li>
    </ol>
