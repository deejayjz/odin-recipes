    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The Scottish Empire Biscuit go by a few different names but they are essentially two shortbread cookies with jam in the
      center with white icing on top and a glace cherry to finish.</p>

      <li>1/4 Cup of Granulated Sugar</li>
      <li>8 Whole Eggs</li>

    </ul>
    

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
      <li>Mix the packed yeast, warm milk and add 5 Tbsp of the bread flour.</li>
      <li>Cover and set he mixture aside for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Put the eggs and granulated sugar in your stand mixer and whisk until smooth.</li>
      <li>Change the attachment on the stand mixer to the dough hook attachment and add in 2 cups bread flour on low speed.</li>
      <li>Mix and then add the salt and remaining bread flour. Be patient and ensure all the bread flour is mixed in.</li>
      <li>Cut the butter into chunks and add in to the mixture. Knead the dough for 2 minutes in the mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Remove from the bowl. The dough is very sticky at this point.</li>
      <li>Use a bench scraper if you need to and add some extra flour to make it easier to work with.</li>
      <li>Shape the dough into a ball. Cover with a towel and leave it to rise for 90 minutes in a warm place.</li>
      <li>Punch down the dough and form 12 small rolls. Or if you want smaller biscuits divide them into 24 rolls.</li>
      <li>Place on a parchment-lined baking tray, cover, and leave to prove in a warm place covered with a towel for 30 mins.</li>
      <li>Brush with the egg wash. I so much prefer to use a silicone pastry brush as they are much easier to clean than the
      traditional ones with bristles.</li>
      <li>Bake for 22-25 mins until golden brown. Make sure you watch them closely as you do not want them to burn!</li>
      <li>While you are waiting for the Empire Biscuits to bake, you can cut the cherries in half.</li>
      <li>Remove the biscuits from the oven and cool before icing.</li>
      <li>You can make your own vanilla icing but it is fine to use store bought frosting.
      Pipe creamy vanilla icing over each roll. The ones in the movie Brave have a four point flower design so we did this
      too! Top off with half a maraschino cherry on each biscuit.</li>

    <h4>Optional Orange Glaze</h4>

      <li>If you want to add a delicious orange flavor to your Brave Empire Biscuits you can easily make this glaze.</li>
      <li>Add one 1 tsp orange flavoring to 1 cup of store-bought vanilla frosting. Make sure you mix it well to evenly distribute
      the flavor.</li>
      <li>If you need the mixture to be looser to make it easier to pipe with then just put it into the microwave for 5 to 10
      seconds.</li>
      <li>Then pour into your piping bag and pipe your design onto your rolls. Add the cherry on the top and leave to set for
      around 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
