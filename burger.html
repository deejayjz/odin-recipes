    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In Pulp Fiction, the burger appears to be a typical American beef burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato on a hamburger
    bun. Multiple real restaurants have featured a "Big Kahuna Burger" on their menus, including Inskip Grill located in
    Tarantino's hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>1 red onion, sliced into rings</ul>
    <ul>2 Tbsp butter, divided</ul>
    <ul>3 thin pineapple slices</ul>
    <ul>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</ul>
    <ul>4 ounces ground beef, divided into two balls</ul>
    <ul>2 slices Monterey jack cheese</ul>
    <ul>King's Hawaiian roll, toasted in butter</ul>
    <ul>1/2 Tbsp ketchup</ul>
    <ul>1/2 Tbsp teriyaki sauce</ul>
    
    <h3>Method</h3>
    
    <ol><strong>STEP 1</strong></ol>
    <ol>In a sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon butter until foaming, and add red onion. Cook slowly over low heat, tossing
        constantly, until soft and caramelized - about 30 minutes. Set aside.</ol>
    
    <ol><strong>STEP 2</strong></ol>
    <ol>Wipe out sauté pan, and heat remaining tablespoon of butter over medium heat until sizzling. Add pineapple slices,
        and
        sauté until lightly charred on both sides. Set aside.</ol>
    <ol>In a large cast iron skillet, heat vegetable oil over high heat, until smoking. Place beef balls several inches
        apart in
        skillet, and smash down using a large, flat spatula. Use a rolling pin or the handle of another spatula to press the
        burgers firmly down, until they are thin and craggly. Cook for approximately 60 seconds, until the bottom is charred
        and
        crispy. Flip, and immediately top with cheese. Remove from heat, but leave burgers in the pan while you assemble, so
        the
        cheese melts completely. Dress bun with ketchup and teriyaki sauce, top with burgers, then caramelized onions and
        pineapple.</ol>
