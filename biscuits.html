    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Scottish Empire Biscuit go by a few different names but they are essentially two shortbread cookies with jam in the
    center with white icing on top and a glace cherry to finish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>1 Package of Active Dry Yeast</ul>
    <ul>1/2 Cup of Warm Whole Milk</ul>
    <ul>5 Tbsp of Bread Flour</ul>
    <ul>1/4 Cup of Granulated Sugar</ul>
    <ul>8 Whole Eggs</ul>
    <ul>3 Cups plus 1 Tbsp Bread Flour</ul>
    <ul>2 tsp Salt</ul>
    <ul>1 1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter at Room Temperature</ul>
    <ul>Eggwash (1 egg + 1 tsp water)</ul>
    <ul>Rich and Creamy Vanilla Frosting</ul>
    <ul>Maraschino Cherries, halved</ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</ol>
    <ol>Mix the packed yeast, warm milk and add 5 Tbsp of the bread flour.</ol>
    <ol>Cover and set he mixture aside for 10 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Put the eggs and granulated sugar in your stand mixer and whisk until smooth.</ol>
    <ol>Change the attachment on the stand mixer to the dough hook attachment and add in 2 cups bread flour on low speed.</ol>
    <ol>Mix and then add the salt and remaining bread flour. Be patient and ensure all the bread flour is mixed in.</ol>
    <ol>Cut the butter into chunks and add in to the mixture. Knead the dough for 2 minutes in the mixing bowl.</ol>
    <ol>Remove from the bowl. The dough is very sticky at this point.</ol>
    <ol>Use a bench scraper if you need to and add some extra flour to make it easier to work with.</ol>
    <ol>Shape the dough into a ball. Cover with a towel and leave it to rise for 90 minutes in a warm place.</ol>
    <ol>Punch down the dough and form 12 small rolls. Or if you want smaller biscuits divide them into 24 rolls.</ol>
    <ol>Place on a parchment-lined baking tray, cover, and leave to prove in a warm place covered with a towel for 30 mins.</ol>
    <ol>Brush with the egg wash. I so much prefer to use a silicone pastry brush as they are much easier to clean than the
    traditional ones with bristles.</ol>
    <ol>Bake for 22-25 mins until golden brown. Make sure you watch them closely as you do not want them to burn!</ol>
    <ol>While you are waiting for the Empire Biscuits to bake, you can cut the cherries in half.</ol>
    <ol>Remove the biscuits from the oven and cool before icing.</ol>
    <ol>You can make your own vanilla icing but it is fine to use store bought frosting.
    Pipe creamy vanilla icing over each roll. The ones in the movie Brave have a four point flower design so we did this
    too! Top off with half a maraschino cherry on each biscuit.</ol>
    <h3>Optional Orange Glaze</h3>
    <ol>If you want to add a delicious orange flavor to your Brave Empire Biscuits you can easily make this glaze.</ol>
    <ol>Add one 1 tsp orange flavoring to 1 cup of store-bought vanilla frosting. Make sure you mix it well to evenly distribute
    the flavor.</ol>
    <ol>If you need the mixture to be looser to make it easier to pipe with then just put it into the microwave for 5 to 10
    seconds.</ol>
    <ol>Then pour into your piping bag and pipe your design onto your rolls. Add the cherry on the top and leave to set for
    around 10 minutes.</ol>
